git commit -m "While loop was used in the Collatz conjecture to take the input and using modulo fuction I was able to determine if the number was even or odd. In the Prime number check I used a for loop since we are looking at a certain range, using modulo against the range I was able determine if the number was a prime or not. For the multiplication table I used two for loops, one for the collum and one for the row, 
I then multiplied each range by each other."
